		<h1> USER TESTING SECTION </h1>

</div>

<div class="col-12 col col-md-6">

	<p>The 1st User Testing phase of the brand HYZAD was based on several test rounds, which resulted in feedback, tips and recommendations of our testers. 
	The Analytic team of the brand HYZAD started with sending out digital paper prototypes to possible customers of the HYZAD target audience. The outcome included some critics according to the structre on specific pages, but the overall feedback was positive and the testers enjoyed the and possible content content and idea of the HYZAD website as well as the purpose.</p>

<div class="col-12 col-md-6">

	<p>The 2nd User Testing phase of the brand HYZAD was focused on the actual website. The Analytics team was working with a broad group of testers in order to achieve a highly professional working website, including high excitement and enjoyment while using the HYZAD website. The test program was using different versions of the HYZAD website, which were achieved by the feedback we got from our testers.  
	The overall feedback started with many structure crtics, such as wrong positioned images and text paragraphs. There was no coherent structure of images and paragraphs on the women and men pages, which was not positive. Furthermore, the tester first did not understand that a user is not able to buy the fashion proudcuts on the HYZAD webiste; HYZAD is just providing inspiration and the link to the actual brand website for a final purchase. Fortunately, the testers always enjoyed the content and visual layout they were exposed to. Additionally, at the beginning HYZAD was struggling with usability issues, but these were fixed immediately. After several tests, the strucutre critics were completely fixed and the testers were all satisfied. As soon as the final visual image and video footage was included in the page, every tester was understanding, accepting and enjoying the purpose and the style of the HYZAD wensite. By gaining important and useful feedback, the HYZAD was able to adapt and to achieve satisfied testers at the end.</p>
