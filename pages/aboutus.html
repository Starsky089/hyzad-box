					<h1> DESIGN JUSTIFICATION / USER TESTING REPORT </h1>
				</div>

				<div class="col-12 col-md-6" id="justification-box">

				<p> The 1st User Testing phase of the brand HYZAD was based on several test rounds, which resulted in feedback, tips and recommendations of our testers. 
	The Analytic team of the brand HYZAD started with sending out digital paper prototypes to possible customers of the HYZAD target audience. The outcome included some critics according to the structre on specific pages, but the overall feedback was positive. The testers enjoyed the current and possible content and idea of the HYZAD website as well as the purpose.<br><br>
	The 2nd User Testing phase of the brand HYZAD was focused on the actual website. The Analytics team was working with a broad group of testers in order to achieve a highly professional working website, that would result in high excitement and enjoyment while using the HYZAD website. The test program was using different versions of the HYZAD website, which were achieved by the feedback we got from our testers. <br><br>  
	The overall feedback started with many structural issues, such as wrong positioned images and text paragraphs. There was no coherent structure of images and paragraphs on the women and men pages, which was not positive. Furthermore, the tester first did not understand that a user is not able to buy the fashion products on the HYZAD webiste; HYZAD is just providing inspiration and is the link to the actual brand website for a final purchase. Fortunately, the testers always enjoyed the content and visual layout they were exposed to.<br>Additionally, at the beginning HYZAD was struggling with usability issues, but these were fixed immediately. After several tests, the structure errors were completely fixed and the testers were all satisfied. As soon as the final visual image and video footage was included in the page, every tester was understanding, accepting and enjoying the purpose and the style of the HYZAD website. By gaining important and useful feedback, HYZAD was able to adapt and therefore achieve satisfied testers at the end. However, after showing the final end result to our testers, they gave us the valuable feedback that the engagement and interaction of the website with its users, could be further improved.<br><br>Further reference to these changes can be found on the images on the right that show the iteration of our prototypes, and upon reflecting on our received feedback, we constructed the final product, which is this website in its current state. </p>

	<h2>Future Progress and Reflections</h2>

	<p>There are some aspects of our initial and desired design that could not be implemented in our final product. The following are some of the elements that we would have furthere liked to implement:</p>
	
		<p>Modal functionality in order to zoom into a picture: this required some deeper understanding of implementing scripts appropiately. Several attempts have taken place but eventually, it was decided to leave this out.<br><br>Google Maps functionality and further improvement: Allowing users to click a desired address from the list and show it immediately on the Google Maps link.<br><br>Implementation of additional animations: We believe this would have improved the interaction of our users, based in our user tests, such as enhancing items while hovering onto them, animation around text in homepage, etc.</p>

	<p> Finally, our biggest challenge during this challenge was to find a proper way to work together using the Github repository and avoid any conflicting errors. Furthermore, we learned that designing for website is a step-by-step process and it is extremely important to iterate as much as possible on your ideas and designs before submitting. Nevertheless, it is wise to take in consideration the top most priorities first, such as functionality and accesability, before working on anything else.</p>
